Currently, when I create a Job Application by pasting a Job Desc, a resume is generated. I may re-generate it, modify the job desc, etc...
What I want is, once everything is ok from my perspective and I feel ready to, I can generate an automated cover letter based on the job desc. Once I click on generate, I should be prompted to fill in a simple question "why do you want to work there?". If I leave it empty, then agent should do its researches on the company and make something up. If filled in, consume this answer for the cover letter.
