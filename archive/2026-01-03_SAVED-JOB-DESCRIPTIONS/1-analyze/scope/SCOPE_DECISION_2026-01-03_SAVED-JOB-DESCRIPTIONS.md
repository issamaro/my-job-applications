# Scope Decision: Saved Job Descriptions

**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Classification:** Single Feature

---

## Request

> Feature 2: Saved Job Descriptions - Allow users to save and edit job descriptions. When a saved job description is modified, automatically regenerate the tailored resume with the updated input. Track version history for traceability. Scope includes: Job description CRUD UI (save, edit, delete), Version tracking for job descriptions, Auto-regeneration trigger on edit, Resume version linking to JD versions.

---

## Size Indicators

- [ ] Contains "and" connecting distinct capabilities
  - "save and edit" are related CRUD operations
  - "auto-regenerate" is a trigger from the edit action
  - These are tightly coupled, not distinct capabilities
- [ ] Affects multiple user personas
  - Only job seekers using the system
- [ ] Spans multiple domains
  - Single domain: job application management
- [ ] Has multiple independent acceptance criteria
  - Criteria are interdependent: edit → triggers regenerate, versions → link to JD versions
- [ ] User mentions phases or iterations
  - No, defined scope from epic breakdown
- [x] Would require > 10 files changed
  - Backend: database.py, schemas.py, routes, services (~5 files)
  - Frontend: components for JD management (~4 files)
  - Tests: test files (~3 files)
  - Total: ~12 files

**Score: 1/6 - Single Feature**

## Decision

Proceed as **single feature** because:

1. **Cohesive capability** - All parts (CRUD, versioning, auto-regenerate) work together to deliver one user value: "manage and iterate on job descriptions without losing work"
2. **Interdependent components** - Version tracking requires CRUD, auto-regenerate requires edit capability - these aren't separable
3. **Existing foundation** - Database already has `job_descriptions` and `generated_resumes` tables with FK relationship; this extends existing infrastructure
4. **Clear boundaries** - Input: job description text; Output: saved JD with version history + linked resumes

## Existing Infrastructure

| Asset | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `job_descriptions` table | Exists | Needs: title field, updated_at, version tracking |
| `generated_resumes` table | Exists | Has FK to job_descriptions; needs version linking |
| `JobDescriptionInput.svelte` | Exists | Needs integration with save/load |
| `ResumeGenerator.svelte` | Exists | Needs saved JD selection |
| `routes/resumes.py` | Exists | Needs JD CRUD endpoints |
