**Classification:** Single Feature (selected from Epic)

## Request

> Sass: refactor/improve strategy
> (Selected from Epic Breakdown: RESUME-SYSTEM-V2)

---

## Size Indicators

- [ ] Contains "and" connecting distinct capabilities
- [ ] Affects multiple user personas
- [ ] Spans multiple domains
- [x] Has multiple independent acceptance criteria
- [ ] User mentions phases or iterations
- [x] Would require > 10 files changed

**Score: 2/6 - Single Feature**

---

## Decision

Proceed as single feature because:
- Single domain: styling/CSS architecture
- Clear scope: refactor existing `main.scss` into modular structure
- No new functionality, only reorganization
- All changes within `src/styles/` directory

---

## Feature Name

**SCSS-REFACTOR**

This name will be used in all subsequent artifacts.

---

## Current State Analysis

**Existing File:** `src/styles/main.scss` (1,047 lines)

Contains:
- Design variables (colors, spacing, typography)
- Base/reset styles
- Component styles (inline, not modular)
- Utility classes
- Animations
- All mixed together in one file

**Build Process:**
- `npm run build:css` → compiles to `public/build/global.css`
- `npm run watch:css` → watches for changes

---

## Next Step

Invoke `/v3-requirements` to define the feature specification.
